1) SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE:
- i) Waterfall Model
- ii) Spiral Model
- iii) v and v model(verification and validation)
- iv) prototype model
- v) derived Model
- vi) Hybrid Model
- vii) Agile Model

2) SOFTWARE TESTING TYPES

3 TYPES
i) White Box Testing
ii) Green Box testing
iii) Black Box testing

White Box testing: 

i. Path testing
ii. Conditional Testing
iii. loop Testing
iv. unit testing
v. Testing Code from the Memory Point of view
vi. testing the code from performance point of view

Blackbox Testing:

i. functional testing
ii. integration testing
iii. System testing
iv. Acceptance Testing
v. Smoke Testing
vi. Globalization testing
vii. Adhoc Testing
viii. Compatibility Testing
ix. Exploratory testing
x. Usability testing
xi. Regression Testing


3) Test case
4) Test Plan
5) STLC(Software Testing Life Cycle)
6) defect tracking/ Defect life cycle


Introduction on automation testing:

def: Test Engineer Write the code/script by using tool like selenium/Appium and run the program against the application, program will automatically test the software / application and give the result as "pass" or "fail" this is called as automation testing.

Example For The Automation testing:

1. customer-->(Swiggy)
      ||
2. requirement --> (food app 1000 pages)
      ||
3. software company(Infosys)
i) Business Analyst
      ||
ii) Developer (developer team)
--developers will look into the requirement and write the code

iii) developers will compress the code into .exe file and install the server
      ||

Test Engineer

1. Test Engineer will manually switch on the computer
2. TE will manually install tool like selenium/Appium
3 TE will write the code/program by using selenium
4. TE will click run button
5. Tool will automatically check for the internet connection
6. program will automatically open the browser
7.program will automatically enters the url(www.swiggy.com)
8. login/welcome page is displayed
9. program automatically enter username and password into login main and click on login button
10. If Home page is displayed == pass
    otherwise == failed
